# Technical Challenge Documentation

## Overview

This documentation outlines the setup process and configurations used to tackle the technical challenge. The solution architecture leverages GitHub Actions for CI/CD, Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) for orchestration, GitOps for operational practices, secret management strategies, monitoring and alerting, and self-healing configurations.

## GitHub CI/CD

GitHub Actions is used to automate the software workflows with CI/CD. It builds, tests, and deploys the code right from GitHub.

### Steps:

1. **Create a Workflow**: Define `.github/workflows/main.yml` with steps for build, test, and deploy.
2. **Configure Secrets**: Store sensitive information like AKS credentials in GitHub Secrets.
3. **Deployment**: Use GitHub Actions to deploy to AKS upon push to the main branch.

## AKS Setup

Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) is used for deploying, managing, and scaling containerized applications.

### Steps:

1. **Create AKS Cluster**: Use Azure CLI or Azure portal to create an AKS cluster.
2. **Configure kubectl**: Connect to your cluster using the `az aks get-credentials` command.
3. **Deploy Application**: Deploy your application using kubectl or GitHub Actions.

## GitOps Tool Installation and Configuration

I used github as the single source of truth to store and ensure the AKS cluster state matches the configuration stored in Git.

## Secret Management Strategy and Tools

Kubernetes Secrets and Azure Key Vault are used to manage sensitive information securely.

### SOPS (Secrets OPerationS):

- Encrypts secrets in VCS, providing a secure way to store sensitive information in Git repositories.
- Works with multiple backends like AWS KMS, GCP KMS, Azure Key Vault, and PGP, allowing for flexible key management.
- Integrates seamlessly into CI/CD pipelines, decrypting secrets on the fly during deployment.

By leveraging Kubernetes Secrets and Azure Key Vault for direct secret management in the cluster, and SOPS for encrypting secrets within our Git repositories, we ensure a comprehensive and secure approach to secret management across our deployment pipeline.

## Monitoring Setup and Alerting Configuration

Prometheus and Grafana are used for monitoring, while Alertmanager handles alerting.

### Steps:

1. **Install Prometheus**: Deploy Prometheus to your AKS cluster for monitoring.
2. **Configure Grafana**: Deploy Grafana for visualization and connect it to Prometheus.
3. **Set Up Alertmanager**: Configure Alertmanager with Prometheus to handle alerts.

## Self-Healing Configuration Using Liveness Probes

Kubernetes liveness probes are configured to automatically restart unhealthy containers.

### Configuration:

- Define liveness probes in your deployment manifests.
- Configure probes to check the health of your application at regular intervals.

## Conclusion

This documentation provides a comprehensive overview of the setup and configuration for the technical challenge, leveraging modern tools and practices for a robust CI/CD pipeline, secret management, monitoring, alerting, and self-healing mechanisms in a Kubernetes environment.
